# this .yaml file is to perform demographic filtering with coarse categorized demographic variables.
# For example, taking a look at income_level_category_13, the categories are coarsened to 3 categories (Under $40,000, 40 to under $100,000, $100,000 or more)

# sum of weights = 10221.000322689664
# number of human respondents = 10916
# this file contains the weighted fraction of demographic groups for each demographic traits
# fractions are caluclated by ignoring nan values

trait_of_interest:
  - age_category_4
  - gender
  - education_level
  - income_level_category_13
